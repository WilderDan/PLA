#Perceptron Learning Algorithm (PLA)

I wrote this for my machine learning course at University of Missouri 
St. Louis (UMSL).

Project 1: 
Implement the PLA (adaptive decision boundary) in a language of your
choice. Choose appropriate training and test data sets of two dimensions 
(points on a plane). Use 10 data points for training and 5 for testing. Submit 
a single doc or pdf file containing the source code, the training and test 
data, a comment on whether the training data points are linearly separable, 
a comment on whether the test points are linearly separable, your initial
choice of the weights and constants, the final solution equation (decision 
boundary), the total number of weight vector updates that your algorithm made,
the total number of iterations made over the training set, and  the final 
misclassification error, if any, on the training data and also on the test data. 
Additional graphic output is not required but will not be penalized.
